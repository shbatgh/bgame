This file is how to help other people understand my code and for me to make it better
First I make my teams
Then I make the function that will run when I need to rerun the game I will fix
this so that it will run certain functions and then if the player wants to for
example open the store the store will open
Then I make the play function which is how you play a match and see if you win
or lose and see how much money you now have
The next class is bet which is how you bet money, if you win you get 4 time the
amount you bet for but if you lose you lose 3 times the money you bet for
Make a class store where you can upgrade your players skills or buy new players
